    "The IOB format is a simple text chunking format that divides the text into chunks and assigns a label to each chunk. The label is a combination of two parts: the type of the named entity and the position of the word in the named entity. The type of the named entity is one of the four types mentioned above. The position of the word in the named entity is one of three positions: B (beginning), I (inside), and O (outside). For example, the word \"New\" in the named entity \"New York\" is labeled as \"B-LOC\" and the word \"York\" is labeled as \"I-LOC\". The word \"I\" in the sentence \"I live in New York\" is labeled as \"O\"."
